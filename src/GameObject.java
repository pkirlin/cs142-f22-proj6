 * something that represents you (your character or player), another character who
 * might be a friend or an enemy, or some object in the environment that you might
 * interact with in some way: food, a wall, something you can pick up and carry
 * around, a vehicle you can get in and drive around, a projectile of some sort, etc.
 *
 * Each object has an (x, y) location, an image filename used to display
 * the object on the canvas, a width and height (images will be automatically
 * resized to fit in the width/height dimensions), and a border color.  The border
 * might be used to show some additional information about an object, such as whether
 * it is "on" or "active" or how much energy it has left.  The border color could
 * be used in a variety of different ways, or you can set it to null to hide the border.
